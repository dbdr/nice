<para>
Nice originates in academic research on object-orientation.
It all started with the 
<ulink url="http://www.exentis.com/Francois.Bourdoncle/popl97.html">
ML-Sub type system</ulink>, presented at the 
Principles Of Programming Languages 1997 conference by Francois Bourdoncle 
and Stephan Merz.
This article present the core type system, and proves its safety property.
</para>

<para>
A <ulink url="http://cristal.inria.fr/~bonniot/bonniot02.ps">
new version of the type system</ulink> was presented at the 
Foundations of Object-Oriented Languages 2002 workshop by Daniel Bonniot.
The presentation is much simpler, and it includes type inference, which is not
yet present in Nice.
</para>

<para>
<ulink url="http://nice.sourceforge.net/DEA.ps">Daniel Bonniot's 
graduation report</ulink> contains information about the language, 
and the theory of <emphasis>abstract interfaces</emphasis> 
as they appear in Nice. 
Since then some names have changed: Bossa became Nice, and 
<emphasis>interfaces</emphasis> are <emphasis>abstract interfaces</emphasis> 
in Nice.
