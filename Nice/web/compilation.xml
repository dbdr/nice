<description>How to structure Nice programs, compile and run them</description>

<para>
Nice source files are grouped by <emphasis>packages</emphasis>.
A package is the compilation unit in Nice.
Each package resides in a separate directory.
I suggest you create a root directory for your nice packages:
</para>

<programlisting>mkdir ~/nice</programlisting>

<para>
Each time you begin writing a new package, just create a directory for it.
For instance, for package <literal>my.program:</literal>
</para>

<programlisting>mkdir -p ~/nice/my/package</programlisting>

<para>
Then you place all the Nice source
files, with <literal>.nice</literal> extension, in that directory. The names of the
files have no importance for the compiler, but they should be meaningful
to you of course.
To compile your new package:
</para>

<programlisting>
cd ~/nice
nicec my.program
</programlisting>

<para>
The reason why it is necessary to enter the packages directory 
(<literal>~/nice</literal>)
is that the default path for looking up source packages 
is the current directory. 
It is possible to specify it using <literal>--sourcepath</literal> option.
The previous exemple is this equivalent to:
<programlisting>nicec --sourcepath=~/nice my.program</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
To get a list of the compiler's command line options, use:
<literal>nicec --help</literal> or <literal>nicec -h</literal>
(GNU style options are used, thanks to package <literal>nice.opt</literal>).
</para>

<para>
If your package has a <literal>void main(String[] args)</literal> 
function definition, then it is executable. 
The compiler accepts the argument <literal>-a program.jar</literal>,
and produces a Jar archive with the given name 
that is appropriate for execution with <literal>java</literal>:
</para>

<programlisting>
nicec -a program.jar my.program
java -jar program.jar
</programlisting>

<para>
The <literal>program.jar</literal> file is self-contained.
It can be run by any simple JVM.
</para>

<para>
All imported packages are found automatically, and recompiled if necessary.
Nice enjoys separate compilation.
</para>

<para>
Instead of starting the compiler in a terminal, you can of course automate
this by using a build system. If you are familiar with make, you can
just invoke the compiler as above in a Makefile. There is also a
<literal>nicec</literal> task for the 
<ulink
url="http://ant.apache.org">Ant build system</ulink>. 
The use of Nice with Ant is
<ulink

documented</ulink> in the Wiki.
