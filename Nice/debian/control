Description: Extension of Java with parametric types, multi-methods, and more.
 Nice is a new object-oriented programming language. 
 .
 It extends Java with many advanced features:
   * parametric types: this is especially for containers (list, hast-tables)
     and allows for shorter and safer code.
   * anonymous functions: functions can be created and manipulated as 
     first-class expressions, just like in Lisp and ML. 
     This is much lighter than Java's anonymous classes in many situations, 
     for instance with listeners in a GUI.
   * multi-methods: they allow methods to be defined outside
     classes. This means that new methods can be defined on classes that
     belong to a different package (even in java.*). 
     Multi-methods alse extend usual methods with the possibility to
     dispatch on every argument, instead of only the receiver class.
     This supersedes the Visitor pattern.
   * tuples: this allows in particular methods to return several values.
   * named and optional parameters to methods.
