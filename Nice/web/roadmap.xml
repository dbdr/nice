<para>
This is the current plan for future versions of the language.
Comments about the new features are welcome. 
This includes arguing whether they are well designed, proposing alternatives,
requesting that some feature should be given a higher priority because
you need them more and proposing new features.
These discussions can take place on 
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=12788">the forums</ulink>, 
on <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12788">the mailing list
</ulink>
or <ulink url="mailto:bonniot@users.sourceforge.net">privately</ulink>
(the first two are prefered).

<para>
<!-- The current stable version is 0.6, released July 11th, 2002. -->
The latest version is 0.7.9, released May 6th, 2003.
It includes all the planned features for version 0.8, which should be
released real soon now!

<para>
This will be the first official stable release of the language. 
With the above features, the language is rich enough to compete with Java 1.4
in every aspect. 
This will be the time for more widespread publicity.
