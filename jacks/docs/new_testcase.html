    Adding a new test case to Jacks is an easy as staying on 17.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <H3>Compiler bugs are hard to find</H3>

    Before adding a test case, one must first identify a problem.
    That may seem obvious at first, but often clearly identifying a problem
    in a compiler is more than half the battle. Compiler bugs
    tend to show up while working on large bodies of
    source code. A developer is then faced with a tough decision,
    should he/she try to figure out what is really causing the compiler
    error or find a work-around for the problem by changing the
    source code?

    <p>

    There is no easy solution to this problem, and we don't pretend
    to offer one. What we do offer is a very simple process that will
    guarantee that once a problem is identified, a compiler developer
    will be able to reproduce the problem and show that a proposed
    fix both solves the original problem and does not cause others.
    An automated regression testing system like Jacks gives the
    compiler developer peace of mind in knowing that a change will
    not break anything, and it makes the user happy because the
    problem will get fixed and stay fixed.

    <p>

    The only catch is that the effectiveness of a regression testing
    system depends on the scope and completeness of the tests. If the
    regression system does not test everything, then you
    can't really be sure that everything works. This is why
    we need your help. With enough community involvement,
    we can reach a critical mass of tests that will make
    Java compiler development significantly easier.

    <p>

    <H3>How does it work?</H3>

    Ok, enough of the "why", lets get down to the "how" of actually
    adding a test case. In this example, we assume that a compiler
    problem related to interfaces and the synchronized keyword
    has already been identified as follows.

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

<code>
<pre>
// File SynchronizedInterface.java

public synchronized interface SynchronizedInterface {}
</pre>
</code>

    <br>

    When compiled with jikes, the following error is generated:

<code>
<pre>
% jikes SynchronizedInterface.java 

Found 1 semantic error compiling "SynchronizedInterface.java":

     3. public synchronized interface SynchronizedInterface {}
               <---------->
*** Error: synchronized is not a valid interface modifier.
</pre>
</code>

    <br>

     A quick look at section 9.1.1 of the
     <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/jTOC.doc.html">JLS</A>
     indicates that synchronized is not a legal modifier
     in this context. If one tries to compile this same
     class with the javac compiler supplied by Sun in JDK 1.1
     release, the following result is generated:

<code>
<pre>
% javac SynchronizedInterface.java
</pre>
</code>

    <br>

     The class compiled without error using Sun's javac compiler, which
     is clearly wrong. Now that the problem can be reproduced, a regression
     test case can be added to the Jacks test suite by following these steps:

<b>
<OL>
<LI>Figure out what directory the test case should go in
<LI>Write the regression test
<LI>Run the new test in the Jacks framework
</OL>
</b>

    <br>

<h3>1. Figure out what directory the test case should go in</h3>

    In the long run, the organization of Jacks test cases will
    determine the success or failure of the project. If the
    layout of tests is messy to the point that it takes
    excessive time to figure out if a given feature is
    tested, people may avoid contributing to the project.
    Existing Jacks tests are located in the <code>jacks/tests</code>
    subdirectory. Within that subdirectory, there are additional
    top level directories that contain related sets of tests.

    <p>

    For example, the <code>jacks/tests/jls</code> top level directory
    stores all of the compiler tests that can be mapped to
    a JLS section. The structure of subdirectories within
    this top level directory mimic the chapter layout of the
    JLS. One would find that all tests related to chapter 7
    of the JLS would be found in the subdirectory
    <code>jacks/tests/jls/packages</code>.

    <p>
    Take a look at the <A HREF="tests.html">Test Index</A> for the most up to
    date JLS to Jacks directory mappings.

    <p>

    The test case is covered by section 9.1.1 of the JLS.
    Chapter 9 is titled "Interfaces", section 9.1 is
    titled "Interface Declarations", and section 9.1.1 is titled
    "Interface Modifiers", so we would expect to put our test
    in a directory named:

    <p>

    <code>
    tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/interface-modifiers
    </code>

    <p>

<h3>2. Write the regression test</h3>


    Once the proper JLS section and directory for the test case
    has been determined, the actual test case can be written.
    Fire up a editor with the file name <code>tests.tcl</code>.
    If a <code>tests.tcl</code> file does not exist already, don't worry,
    just create the regression test and save it with the file name tests.tcl.

    <p>

    And now for the real fun, the writing of the test. The format of
    a regression test in the tcltest framework is as follows:

<code>
<pre>
tcltest::test NAME DESCRIPTION {
    COMMANDS
} EXPECTED_RESULT
</pre>
</code>

    <p>

    Don't worry if any of that looks confusing at first. It is really simple.
    Keep in mind the Jacks convention for determining the name of a given
    test case. This naming convention is required so that tests case
    documentation can be generated automatically.
    The <code>NAME</code> of the regression test should be the JLS
    section number that corresponds to the directory where the test
    case is located, followed by a dash and a unique test number.
    This test falls under section 9.1.1 of the JLS and it is the
    first test in section 9.1.1, so the <code>NAME</code> is 9.1.1-1.

    <p>

    The <code>DESCRIPTION</code> can be anything you want it to be. The
    <code>DESCRIPTION</code> is just a user provided description of the
    test, it is not actually used by the system. The only thing to note
    is that {} characters should be used around the description string.

    <p>

    The <code>COMMANDS</code> section could contain any Tcl commands, but
    most of the time you will just want to use the <code>saveas</code>,
    <code>compile</code>, <code>empty_class</code>, and
    <code>empty_main</code> methods supplied as part of the Jacks
    framework.

    <p>

    The <code>saveas</code> command takes two arguments, the file name
    and the data to be saved in the file, and returns the name of the
    file that was just saved. Like so:
<code>
<pre>
saveas SynchronizedInterface.java {public synchronized interface SynchronizedInterface {}}
</pre>
</code>

    The <code>compile</code> command takes a number of command
    line arguments and passes them to the actual java compiler.
    The <code>compile</code> command will return 
    <code>PASS</code>, <code>FAIL</code>, or <code>WARN</code>,
    to indicate the exit status of the compiler.

    <p>

    The <code>empty_class</code> command is a convenience wrapper
    which takes two arguments: the name of a class, and the class
    contents. It then creates and compiles &lt;name&gt;.java with your
    contents.  Likewise, <code>empty_main</code> takes a name of a
    class, and the contents of the <code>main</code> method of that
    class. For example:

<code>
<pre>
empty_main Addition { int two = 1 + 1; }
</pre>
</code>

    is shorthand for:

<code>
<pre>
compile [saveas Addition.java {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int two = 1 + 1;
    }
}]
</code>
</pre>

    <p>

    The <code>EXPECTED_RESULT</code> is where the result one expects
    from the <code>compile</code> command should be placed.

    <p>

    In our interface example, we expect the compile to fail.
    Wrapping all of this together, one could write
    the test case like so:

    <p>

<code>
<pre>
tcltest::test 9.1.1-1 {should generate error on synchronized interface} {
    saveas SynchronizedInterface.java \
        {synchronized interface SynchronizedInterface {}}

    compile SynchronizedInterface.java
} FAIL
</pre>
</code>


    One could even combine the invocations of saveas and compile
    to simplify things a bit. Remember that the saveas
    command returns the name of the saved file, which is then passed to
    the compile command.

<code>
<pre>
tcltest::test 9.1.1-1 {should generate error on synchronized interface} {
    compile [saveas SynchronizedInterface.java \
        {synchronized interface SynchronizedInterface {}}]
} FAIL
</pre>
</code>

    <p>

    After saving the tests.tcl file, the regression test can now
    be run in the jacks framework.

    <p>


<h3>3. Run the new test in the Jacks framework</h3>

    Once you have created the tests.tcl file, you can easily run the tests
    using the jacks shell script, assuming you already have it on your PATH.
    In the following example, the regression tests in the tests.tcl file
    will be run with the javac and jikes compilers.

    <p>

<code>
<pre>
% cd tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/interface-modifiers
% jacks javac
Testing javac
Working directory is /usr/local/project/jacks/tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/i
nterface-modifiers
compile = /usr/local/jdk118_v1/bin/javac  ...
run     = /usr/local/jdk118_v1/bin/java  ...
tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/interface-modifiers

==== 9.1.1-2 adding the public keyword to an interface declared
        as public triggers a bug in the javac shipped with jdk 1.1 FAILED
==== Contents of test case:

    compile [saveas PublicSynchronizedInterface.java  "public synchronized interface Public
SynchronizedInterface {}"]

---- Result was:
PASS
---- Result should have been:
FAIL
==== 9.1.1-2 FAILED
javac:  Total   1      Passed  0       Skipped 0       Failed  1
</pre>
</code>

    <p>

    You probably will not care about most of this output, just note that
    the test ran and it failed with javac. Now lets run the same test
    with the jikes compiler.

    <p>

<code>
<pre>
% jacks jikes
Testing jikes
Working directory is /usr/local/project/jacks/tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/i
nterface-modifiers
CLASSPATH = /usr/local/jdk118_v1/lib/classes.zip
compile = /home/mo/project/build/jikes/src/jikes  ...
run     = /usr/local/jdk118_v1/bin/java  ...
tests/jls/interfaces/interface-declarations/interface-modifiers
jikes:  Total   1      Passed  1      Skipped 0       Failed  0
</pre>
</code>

    <br>
    <br>

    Thats all there is to it! The test case has now been integrated into
    the Jacks regression testing system and it has been double checked to
    ensure that it is working as expected. Note how easy it was to
    add the test and then run it under
    multiple compiler environments. All that is left to do is submit
    a patch for this new test case to the
