My experience thus far with Nice is very positive. 
The language design is very elegant. 
It is so nice to have a language that has a powerful type system 
combined with multiple dispatch. 
It is like combining the best of ML and Dylan. 
Kudos.

I am really excited by Nice.

It seems to offer many advantages over straight Java.

I wish Javasoft was more open to enhancing the language.  
Your stuff looks like a very nice, usable, and functional super-set.
