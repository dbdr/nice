Plan for the introduction of new features in future versions.

<para>
This is the current plan for future versions of the language.
Comments about the new features are welcome. 
This includes arguing whether they are well designed, proposing alternatives,
requesting that some feature should be given a higher priority because
you need them more and proposing new features.
These discussions can take place on 
<ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=12788">the forums</ulink>, 
on <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=12788">the mailing list
</ulink>
or <ulink url="mailto:bonniot@users.sourceforge.net">privately</ulink>
(the first two are prefered).

<varlistentry><term>0.6 (June 2002)</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Harmonize syntax for function types as 
<literal>int->int</literal> and <literal>(String, int)->boolean</literal>.
Introduce automatic constructors that initialize the fields, using
optional named parameters. 
This means that it is not necessary to write the code for the constructor,
nor for a simple creation function. Example:
<programlisting><![CDATA[
class LinkedList<T>
{
  T head;
  ?LinkedList<T> tail;
}
...
LinkedList<int> l = 
  new LinkedList(head: 1, 
                 tail: new LinkedList(head: 2, tail: null));
]]></programlisting>
</para>
</listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term>0.8 (June 2002)</term>
<listitem>
<para>
Add various missing Java constructs: synchronized statements
and Java 1.4 style assertions.
Also consider more Design By Contract features: pre- and post-conditions, 
class invariants. These might be part of a later release.
</para>

<varlistentry><term>1.0 (July 2002)</term>
<listitem>
<para>
First official stable release of the language. 
With the above features, the language is rich enough to compete with Java 1.4
in every aspect. We must have a reasonably complete User's manual by then.
This will be the time for more widespread publicity.
