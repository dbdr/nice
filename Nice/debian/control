Description: Extension of Java with parametric types, multi-methods, and more.
 Nice is a new object-oriented programming language. 
 .
 It extends Java with many advanced features:
   * parametric types: this is especially for containers (list, hast-tables)
     and allow shorter and safer code.
   * higher-order functions: functions can be manipulated as first-class
     objects, just like in Lisp, ML. This is much lighter than Java's
     inner classes in many situations, for instance with listenersin a GUI.
   * multi-methods: they allow methods to be defined outside
     classes. This means that new methods can be defined on classes that
     belong to a different package (even in java.*). 
     Multi-methods alse extend usual methods with the possibility to
     dispatch on every argument, instead of only the receiver.
     This superseeds the Visitor pattern.
   * tuples: this allows in particular methods to return several values.
   * named and optional parameters to methods.
