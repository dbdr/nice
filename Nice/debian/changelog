nice (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recognise the standard arrow notation for functional types
      int->int  (int,int)->int  (int->int)->int
    The old notation fun(int)(int) is deprecated and will be removed
    before version 1.0
  * Assigning a possibly null value to a variable of non-null type
    now produces an error instead of a warning.
  * Fixes bug that considered that 
      int a = 10, b;
    initializes both a and b to 10.
  * Fixed variable initialization analysis for do-while loops.
  * Make the compiler compatible with JDK 1.4
  * Fixed bug on MS-Windows with archive creation because of the 
    case-insensivity of the file system.
  * Fixed creation of archive from up-to-date packages stored in jar.
  * Accept anonymous functions that do nothing.
  * Editor (emacs) mode is now driven by command-line instead of inspecting
    the EMACS environment variable. This works around a bug in emacs 21.2.1
    and might be more portable. Also makes it easier to write a nice-mode
    for other editors without changing the existing code or script.

  * Accepts constants:
      final String s1 = "Java style";
      final s3 = "The type of constants can be omitted";
  * More compatibility with Java:
    - checks that all statements are reachable
    - checks that local variables are assigned before use
    - classes can be declared public or private
    - ...
    More than half of the Jacks (java compiler testsuite) tests now pass!
    Most failures come from the difference in the syntax of method declaration.
  * Arrays of void values are forbidden. They most probably originate from
    a bug in the source program.
  * Better handling of inhomogenous tuples with native types (e.g. <int, long>)
  * Better wrapping/unwrapping code for arrays used as Collections.
  * Bugfixes for some polymorphic operations on arrays.
  * Bugfixed the bitshift operators >>, >>> and <<.

nice (0.0.020226) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug that prevented using "this" in overriden native methods.
  * Better error messages for method calls with wrong number of arguments.
  * Accept methods with no implementation when their domain is empty.
  * Abstract interfaces are fully qualified just like classes and 
    correctly list their super-interfaces in the package interface.
    This really makes it possible to use them across packages.
  * Various other bugfixes.

nice (0.0.020205) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow multiple variables to be defined together, as in:
  	int x = 1, y;
  * Allow variable declaration in tuple affectation:
  	(int x, int y) = f(0);
  * Added 'break' and 'continue' statements.
  * Implemented 'do' loops.
  * Allow overriding of native java methods. It is now possible to 
    define a subclass of a java class or interface and override the methods.
  * Changed compilation scheme for method alternatives. This results in 
    shorter class files and more intuitive stack traces.

nice (0.0.020105) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allowed to change the type of native class fields.
    This allows in particular to use System.out.println() and such again.
  * Fixed type of if expressions in the presence of non-nullness inference.

nice (0.0.020102) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made nicec smart about when a local variable might be null.
  * Added the 'instanceof' and '~' (bitwise complement) keywords.
  * Do not stop at the first syntax or type error in more situations.
  * Ehanced error messages.
  * Emacs mode: allow to interactively set the compiler's location 
    (the string variable 'nice-program').
