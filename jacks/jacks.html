<A NAME="WHATIS"><H3>What is Jacks?</H3></A>
Jacks is a free test suite designed to detect bugs
in a Java compiler. We guarantee that it will
find at least one bug in any supported Java
compiler, in fact it may find more than one.
Jacks is not designed to test a Java runtime
(JVM) or Java class libraries. The
<A HREF="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">Mauve</A>
project already aims to do that.

<p>

Jacks includes a collection of Java compiler tests
contributed by people on the net. Jacks is free software
licensed under the terms of the
<A HREF="COPYING">GPL</A>.
A test case must be licensed under the terms
of the GPL to be suitable for inclusion into Jacks,
but authors retain the original copyright.
The license used by the Jacks test suite does
not effect your ability to run the suite with
any free or non-free Java compiler.

<p>

The layout of
<A HREF="docs/tests.html">
directories in the Jacks test suite

mimics chapters from the JLS.<br>

<A NAME="INSTALL"><H3>Install Requirements</H3></A>

Tcl version 8.3 is required as it provides
the regression testing framework Jacks depends
on. Older versions of Tcl will not work as they
do not include the tcltest extension and they
do not support Unicode character sets.

<p>

Windows users can download the
<A HREF="http://downloads.activestate.com/ActiveTcl/Windows/8.3.4/ActiveTcl8.3.4.1-9.win32-ix86.exe">
Tcl/Tk for Windows installer
</A>.

<p>

Red Hat 6.X Linux (x86) users can
<A HREF="http://jfontain.free.fr/tcl-8.3.2-1.i386.rpm">
download an RPM
</A>. Red Hat 7.X ships with Tcl 8.3.

<p>

Everyone else will need to build it from source:

<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tcl/tcl8.3.4.tar.gz">
tcl8.3.4.tar.gz
</A>.

<p>

Once Tcl is installed, you will need the Jacks source
code from the CVS. The CVS module for jacks can be
fetched like so:

<code>
<pre>
setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anoncvs@oss.software.ibm.com:/usr/cvs/jikes

cvs login
paswsd anoncvs

cvs checkout jacks
</pre>
</code>

<p>

<A NAME="CONFIG"><H3>Configure Jacks for your system</H3></A>
Before running the tests, you will need to tell Jacks
where you have installed each of the compilers
you intend to use. A setup file exists for each supported
compiler. For example, if you want to run tests with
the jikes compiler, you would need to edit
the jikes_setup configuration file so that includes
the path name where your jikes compiler is installed.
You may also want to set the CLASSPATH that will
be used for the tests and the optional path name
of the Java runtime to use for runtime tests. You
can add any number of configuration files. To
remove a configuration you do not want, just delete
the setup file for that configuration.

<ul>
<li>
javac_setup (JDK 1.2 or 1.3, JDK 1.1 is discouraged)
<li>
jikes_setup (<A HREF="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/">Jikes Project</A>)
<li>
kaffe_setup (<A HREF="http://www.kaffe.org">Kaffe Project</A>
uses the
<A HREF="http://www.dms.at/kopi/kjc.html">Kopi Compiler</A>)

<li>
gcj_setup (<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/java/">GCJ Project</A>)
</ul>


<p>

<A NAME="RUNING"><H3>Running Jacks regression tests</H3></A>

To run the tests, invoke the
jacks shell script and pass it the
name of the compiler you want to
test. You will want to put the
toplevel directory on your PATH
so that you can run the jacks shell
script.

Test the javac compiler like this:<br><br>

<code>
<pre>
% jacks javac
</pre>
</code>

<p>

The above command will recurse into
subdirectories and run all the tests
it finds using the javac compiler.
If any of the tests fail, an
error will be displayed.

<p>

You can also run tests with multiple
compilers using a single command. This
example runs the tests using javac
and then jikes.<br><br>

<code>
<pre>
% jacks "javac jikes"
</pre>
</code>

<p>

It is also possible to run tests using
all of the supported compilers. The following
command shows how this is done:<br><br>

<code>
<pre>
% jacks all
</pre>
</code>

<p>

You can run the tests in a specific
subdirectory like this:

<code>
<pre>
% cd tests/jls/packages/package-declarations/unnamed-packages
% jacks jikes
</pre>
</code>

<p>

In addition, you can pass patterns as the
third argument. In this way, you can run only
those tests that match a given pattern.

<code>
<pre>
% jacks jikes "*int*"
</pre>
</code>

The above command will run all the test
with names that match the pattern *int*.
You can also pass multiple patterns.

<code>
<pre>
% jacks jikes "*int* test-1 *foo-1"
</pre>
</code>

<p>

The last and perhaps most interesting feature
of Jacks is the ability to generate
regression reports. These reports show
how the current test results have changed
with respect to the previous results.
This is very useful since you can run the
tests and check the results to see if
any changes you made caused regressions.
This really makes a big difference when
there are a large number of tests, since
otherwise you would not know if a failing
test was failing before or is now failing
because of your changes. To generate a
changes file for the jikes target, run:

<code>
<pre>
% jacks loggen jikes
</pre>
</code>

That will generate a <code>logging/jikes.changes</code>.
The first set of entries are the most recent changes.
A transition of <code>{PASSED FAILED}</code> indicates
a regression while a transition of
<code>{FAILED PASSED}</code> indicates a bug fix.
Note that generating a changes file requires a
cvs client and network access.

<p>

The Jacks suite also includes test that
require a Java runtime in addition
to a Java compiler. These tests are
located in the
<code>tests/runtime</code> directory.

<p>

Tests that apply to only a specific compiler
are included in a top level directory named after
the compiler. For example, tests in the
<code>tests/gcj</code> directory will only be
run when testing with the gcj compiler.

<p>

You can clean up generated files after
a test run with the following command:

<code>
<pre>
% jacks clean
</pre>
</code>

<p>

<A NAME="NEWTEST"><H3>Adding a new test case</H3></A>

Adding a new test case to Jacks is very easy. One of the
main goals for Jacks was to create a set of tests that
could be extended with minimal effort. A detailed
example of 
<A HREF="docs/new_testcase.html">Adding A Test Case</A>
is provided.

<p>


<A NAME="REVIEWTESTS"><H3>Review existing tests</H3></A>

A nicely
<A HREF="docs/tests.html">
cross referenced index
</a>
of every test in the Jacks
suite is provided. You can look up a test case by
test number, find the JLS section that a given test
directory refers to, review each of the test that
apply to a given compiler, or simply review all the
test that apply to a given JLS section.

<p>
