nice (0.0.020200) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow multiple variables to be defined together, as in:
	int x = 1, y;
  * Allow variable declaration in tuple affectation:
  	(int x, int y) = f(0);
  * Allow overriding of native java methods. It is now possible to 
    define a subclass of a java class or interface and override the methods.

  * Allowed to change the type of native class fields.
    This allows in particular to use System.out.println() and such again.
  * Fixed type of if expressions in the presence of non-nullness inference.
