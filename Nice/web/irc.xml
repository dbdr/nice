<para>
There is an online discussion channel dedicated to the Nice
programming language, since June 15th 2003. The developers often meet
there to discuss about the implementation, or about new features.
Users are welcome too. So pop by and be our guests! (Most developers
are currently from Europe, and we are there during the day or the evening).
